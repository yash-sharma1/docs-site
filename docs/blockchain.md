# Binance Chain's Blockchain

The purpose of the new blockchain and DEX is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.

## Consensus Details

Binance Chain is a peer-to-peer distributed system, connecting together multiple clients that reach consensus on their views of the "state of the world". Binance Chain uses [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) BFT consensus and has a dedicated `application layer` that runs upon it. A simplified overview of the application's architecture might look something like this:

```
+------------+-----------+
| RPC API    | Web API   |
+------------------------+---------+
| Asset Management | Match Engine  |
+----------------------------------+
| Account Management | Governance  |---------> crypto and blockchain governance
+----------------------------------+
| State Caching and Persisence     +-+
+----------------------------------+ |
| Consensus Protocol               | |
+----------------------------------+ |-----> revised Tendermint
| P2P Protocol                     | |
+----------------------------------+ |
| Networking    |  Database        +-+
+----------------------------------+

```

## Node Roles

### What is a `Validator`?

Validators are a group of IT infrastructure who take the responsibility to maintain the Binance 
Chain/DEX data and validate all the transactions. They would join the consensus procedure and 
vote to produce blocks. The fees would be collected and distributed among all validators. 
You can consider Validator as "miner" in Bitcoin and Ethereum and similar concepts exist in dPoS 
blockchain as EOS or dBFT in NEO. The initial validators are selected from trusted members of the 
Binance community, and will eventually expand to more members as the Binance blockchain and 
ecosystem matures, this responsibility will be distributed. The decentralized governance procedure
would be introduced and executed. More qualified organization/individual can become Validator.


### What is a `Witness Node`?

`Witness Node` are the majority nodes of Binance Chain. Although they do not join consensus process 
and produce blocks, they do:

- witnes consensus process
- serve as data replicas and propagate the chain states around
- receive transactions and broadcast them to all other nodes including `Validator`.

### What is `Accelerate Node`?

Please check [here](faq.md#what_is_the_accelerated_node).

## Blocking

Binance Chain uses a similar block structure as Tendermint proposes, with a size limit as 10 megabytes. 
It is expected a block would be produced on a-few-of-seconds level among validators, and can include 
from 0 up to several thousands of transactions.

## Blockchain State

Blockchain state stores the below information:

- account and balances
- fees
- token information
- trading pairs
- tick size and lot size
- governance information

please note the transactions are not stored as chain state, because they are stored on blocks, while 
trades are not stored as state either, because they can be reproduced via balances and transactions.

## Cryptographic Design

### Account and Address
For normal users, all the keys and addresses can be generated via Binance [Web Wallet](https://testnet.binance.org/create).

This default wallet would use a similar way to generate keys as Bitcoin, i.e. use 256 bits entropy to generate a 24-word mnemonic based on [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), and then use the mnemonic and an empty passphrase to generate a seed; finally use the seed to generate a master key, and derive the private key using BIP32/BIP44 with HD prefix as `"44'/714'/"`, which is reserved at [SLIP 44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md). 
        
>714 comes from Binance's birthday, July 14th. :)

#### Keys
Binance Chain uses the same elliptic curve cryptography as the current [Bitcoin implementation](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/tree/master/btcec), i.e. `secp256k1`. Its private key is 32 bytes while public key is 33 bytes.

#### Address

Essentially addresses on Binance Chain are 20 bytes and calculated via formula: `Address = RIPEMD160(SHA256(public key))`

The address is presented via [bech32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) format with a checksum and human-read prefix. For Binance Chain address, the prefix is `bnb` for production network, and `tbnb` for testnet, which is reserved at [SLIP 173](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0173.md).

#### Signature

Binance Chain uses ECDSA signature on curve Secp256k1 against `SHA256` hash of the byte array of encoded transaction, in the same way as the current Bitcoin, according to RFC 6979 and BIP 62.
