# List a Trading Pair

## How can a trading pair be created?
So far Binance DEX still adheres to the idea that the most efficient and low cost way to perform trading and 
price-discovery is still to use single order book. This single order book is managed and replicated across all 
full nodes with the same, deterministic matching logic.

Simply allowing trading between two assets sounds 'perfect', however it is expensive for not only the network 
runners but also the users in long term (liquidity cost can be much larger). In order to efficiently use the 
network, Binance Chain only list assets against BNB and other widely accepted market benchmark assets. After 
an asset is issued, anyone can "propose" to all validators to list it against particular benchmark assets. 
Validators would vote to accept the proposal. Fee would be charged to prevent abuse of the proposing and 
endorse the asset. Once the proposal is accepted, the owner of the base asset can list the trading pair 
via interfaces.


## List Transaction


### Create a proposal

Assume that the token you want to list already exists. Then you need to create a proposal to list this token
against one benchmark asset.

```bash
➜  test git:(master) ✗ ./bnbcli gov submit-list-proposal --from test --deposit 10000000000:BNB \
--base-asset-symbol AAA-254 --quote-asset-symbol BNB --init-price 100000000 --title "list AAA-254/BNB" \
--description "list AAA-254/BNB" --expire-time 1570665600 --chain-id=chain-bnb --node=172.22.41.165:26657 --json
Password to sign with 'test':
{  
   "Height":"281822",
   "TxHash":"55966E369E567DF55B061E129EAA40EA09B5AA2F",
   "Response":{  
      "data":"Hg==",
      "log":"Msg 0: ",
      "tags":[  
         {  
            "key":"YWN0aW9u",
            "value":"c3VibWl0LXByb3Bvc2Fs"
         },
         {  
            "key":"cHJvcG9zZXI=",
            "value":"Ym5jMTdrd3pudWxqc3k0bjg5d2NqZDZlc3gyajV0MHczMjZjMDN4aHly"
         },
         {  
            "key":"cHJvcG9zYWwtaWQ=",
            "value":"Hg=="
         },
         {  
            "key":"YWN0aW9u",
            "value":"c3VibWl0X3Byb3Bvc2Fs"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

You need to specify the base asset you want to list, quote asset and init price. And when the proposal is 
passed, you should use the identical params to list.

And you also have to set expire time after which you will not be able to list even though proposal is passed.

### Deposit

Before validators can vote on the proposal you created, you need to deposit enough BNB (for now is 2000 BNB). You 
may have already deposit a number of BNB when you propose, in the upper case, it is 100 BNB. So now you still 
need to deposit another 1900 BNB.

```bash
➜  test git:(master) ✗ ./bnbcli gov deposit --deposit 190000000000:BNB --from test --proposal-id 14 
--chain-id=chain-bnb --node=172.22.41.165:26657 --json

   "Response":{  
      "log":"Msg 0: ",
      "tags":[  
         {  
            "key":"YWN0aW9u",
            "value":"ZGVwb3NpdA=="
         },
         {  
            "key":"ZGVwb3NpdGVy",
            "value":"Ym5jMTdrd3pudWxqc3k0bjg5d2NqZDZlc3gyajV0MHczMjZjMDN4aHly"
         },
         {  
            "key":"cHJvcG9zYWwtaWQ=",
            "value":"Hg=="
         },
         {  
            "key":"YWN0aW9u",
            "value":"ZGVwb3NpdA=="
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

### Wait for voting result

When you have deposited enough BNB, the proposal's status will switch to `VotingPeriod`. Then you should wait
for voting result from validators (for now is two weeks).

If proposal is rejected by validator, the money you have deposited will be distribute to validators.

If proposal is passed, BNB you have deposited will be returned.

You can query proposal status via CLI.

```bash
➜  test git:(master) ✗ ./bnbcli gov proposal --proposal-id 15 --chain-id=chain-bnb --node=172.22.41.165:26657
{
  "type": "gov/TextProposal",
  "value": {
    "proposal_id": "15",
    "title": "list AAA-254/BNB",
    "description": "{\"base_asset_symbol\":\"AAA-254\",\"quote_asset_symbol\":\"BNB\",\"init_price\":100000000,\"description\":\"list AAA-254/BNB\",\"expire_time\":\"2019-10-10T00:00:00Z\"}",
    "proposal_type": "ListTradingPair",
    "proposal_status": "Passed",
    "tally_result": {
      "yes": "100000000000",
      "abstain": "0",
      "no": "0",
      "no_with_veto": "0"
    },
    "submit_time": "2018-12-25T09:17:56.128860238Z",
    "total_deposit": [
      {
        "denom": "BNB",
        "amount": "200000000000"
      }
    ],
    "voting_start_time": "2018-12-25T09:21:14.282127201Z"
  }
}
```

### List 

When proposal is passed, the owner of the token to be listed can list the token before `expire_time` specified.

```bash
➜  test git:(master) ✗ ./bnbcli dex list -s AAA-254 --quote-asset-symbol BNB --from test \
--init-price 100000000 --proposal-id 15 --chain-id=chain-bnb --node=172.22.41.165:26657 --json
{  
   "Height":"282409",
   "TxHash":"77AE3D190F430FE6E4B1A9659BEBB3F022CF7631",
   "Response":{  
      "log":"Msg 0: ",
      "tags":[  
         {  
            "key":"YWN0aW9u",
            "value":"ZGV4TGlzdA=="
         }
      ]
   }
}
```
